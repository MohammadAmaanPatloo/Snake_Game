# Snake_Game

<p>This is a classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a snake that moves around a grid-based game board, aiming to eat food and grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen, along with the highest score achieved (stored in the browser's local storage). The game includes audio effects for eating food, game over, and moving the snake.</p>
